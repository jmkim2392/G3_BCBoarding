                        <h3>Choosing your Outerwear</h3>
                        <p> The outerwear you choose is really important as it's your main source of protection against the mountain. There are a lot of factors you need to consider to ensure you have the best outwear that suits all your needs. These include, material, utility, fit, and price. The materials can range from polyester, nylon, microfibers, and gore-tex. If you have room in your budget, gore-tex is the best choice as its completely waterproof. Otherwise, all three other materials will also do you fine. In terms of utility, you would want to consider whether you want insulation or you want to layer it with other clothes. Another aspect that people forget to consider is utility pockets. You often end up carrying a bunch of stuff such as phone, wallet, keys, ipods, etc. Unless you intend on having a bag with you, its best to make sure your outerwear has extra pockets for them. Lastly, most prefer a baggy fit for its complete range of motion, but there are other fits out there to suit your preferences.   </p>

                        <h3>Types of Snowboards</h3>
                        <p>The best all-mountain snowboard of 2016-2017 is the brainstorm by Slash. This board is a good example of an all around snowboard. If you're not sure what type of snowboarder you are, all-mountain boards are the best option as it should suit most terrains including parks. Overall, you would want a board that is a directional twin which has a symmetrical shape. If you want a more playful board specifically for parks, you would select a board with lower flex rating. Aside from those aspects, the only thing you have to consider is the board's compatibility with your bindings. Most will have standardized insert patterns, but if the two are different you will have to reconsider one of the two to accomodate the other.</p>

                        <h3>Bindings</h3>
                        <p>Similar to snowboards, when choosing a set of bindings, its best to figure out what your riding style is. The flex ratings on the bindings will differ based on your style. If you plan on spending most of your time in terrain parks or doing freestyle riding, softer flex is the way to go. For an all-mountain rider, or someone who just wants 1 set for all types, a medium flex should do justice. Lastly, if you're all in for deep-powder and speed on tough terrains, a stiffer flex will provide you with better response, energy transfer to the snowboard for going as fast as you can. Aside from your riding style, you should also consider the insert patterns on the snowboard.</p>

                        <h3>Boots</h3>
                        <p> For boots, the most important aspect you should consider is the fit. Since you'll be strapped in your boots on and off the mountain, making them as comfortable as you can is the obvious choice. The boots should fit you snugly, but not to a point of pain. Most boots will take a few days for your feet to settle in, so be aware that it will be tighter than normal at first. Some higher price point boots will have heat molding liners to better adjust to your feet and increase comfort levels as well. As with all snowboarding gear, softer flex is preferred by park riders and stiff flex for freeriders. In addition, there are numerous lacing systems that you can choose from. Have a look at all the types of lacing systems before you finish your purchase as it can make or break your experience with the boots.</p>
